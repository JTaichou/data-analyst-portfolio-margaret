# My Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi! My name is Margaret, I am 28 years old and I live in Pskov, Russia.  
I have two cats named Asya and Ashraf 😺, and my hobbies are playing gacha games (Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves, Honkai: Star Rail), reading manga and books, and going for walks.

This repository is the beginning of my journey to become a Junior Data Analyst.  
I am learning Python and data analysis tools to change my career and find a calmer, better-paid job.

## Project 1: Hello World + Personal Info
My first Python script that prints information about me and does a simple calculation.

## Project 2: Weekly Expenses Analysis
This program analyzes a list of daily expenses.
It calculates the total amount of money spent and the average expense per day.
The program also finds the highest single expense and shows its category and date.
All results are printed in a clear and readable format.
